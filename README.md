### Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning
!Water Quality

Welcome to the Water Quality Prediction project! In this repository, we’ve built a robust machine learning model to predict whether a water sample is potable or not. Our model utilizes features such as pH, turbidity, and sulphate content to make accurate predictions. Let’s dive into the details!

Introduction
Clean water is essential for human health, and predicting water quality accurately can aid in making informed decisions. Our goal is to create a reliable model that can assess water samples and classify them as potable or non-potable.

### Data Preprocessing
Before diving into model building, we performed essential data preprocessing steps:
Handling Missing Values: We imputed missing values using appropriate techniques.
Outlier Detection: We identified and handled outliers to ensure robust model performance.
Data Splitting: We split the dataset into training and testing subsets.

### Feature Engineering
Feature engineering plays a crucial role in model performance. Here’s what we did:
Feature Extraction: Extracted relevant features from raw data.
Feature Scaling: Ensured all features were on the same scale.
Domain-Specific Features: Created additional features based on domain knowledge.

### Model Building
We experimented with several machine learning algorithms:
Support Vector Classifier (SVC): A powerful classifier for binary classification.
Decision Tree: A simple yet effective tree-based model.
Random Forest: Our final choice due to its high accuracy (98%) on test data.

### Deployment
We deployed our model using Flash. Users can input water quality parameters, and our model will predict whether the water sample is potable or not.

### Results
Our Random Forest model achieved an impressive F1 score of 0.77 on the test data. This accuracy ensures reliable predictions for real-world applications.
